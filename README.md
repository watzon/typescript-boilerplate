This is a basic boilerplate for setting up new Typescript projects for Node or the browser. It comes with testing, linting, and building pre-configured.

## Usage

1. Clone this repo to the your desired project path:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/watzon/typescript-boilerplate.git project-name
    ```

2. Change into the project directory and install dependencies:

    ```shell
    cd project-name
    npm install
    ```

3. Make your modifications, using `npm start` to run `src/index.ts` using `ts-node`. You can also use `npm run build` to build your source files into the `build` directory.
